    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was a client looking to expand their game "Draw It or Lose It" to a wider audience.  I designed a client-server architecture for their game so they could easily expand their offering to multiple operating systems.
    
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I did well converting the companies requirements into design constraints.  I also did well genarating follow up questions for the company to better guide design decisions.  The benefits and disadvantages of the different operating systems were also well researched for the server recommendations.
    
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document set expectations for the code.  This not only included better understanding the clients and users requirements, but also the expected architecture of the code.  The document set the direction for the code I developed.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would expand upon the "Development Tools" comparisons.  I listed the industry standard tools used by operating platforms, but I did not explore the pros and cons of each tool in as thorough detail as I would have liked.  I could have included costs associated with different technologies, how well known they are, or how easy they are to use.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I built the users needs into the project in a few ways.  The users need of developing an application that reaches as many people as possible informed my decision to use a client-server architecture.  The users need for a secure application informed my decision to use a Linux based server.  
    
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach for designing this software involved finding the project requirements, then structuring the data to create reusable and extensible code.  Data was also structured with a server-authoritative design in mind to increase security and prevent cheating.  In the future I would likely use diagramming software and design documents to help me analyze and design a project.
